				The Robotics Club at UCSB is a project-oriented club composed of students interested in the many fields related to robotics. We participate in several competitions throughout the year, as well as volunteer work, educational outreach programs, and working on other member-initiated projects. Students of all majors and skill levels with an interest in learning more about robotics are strongly encouraged to join and participate in the activities held throughout the year!
