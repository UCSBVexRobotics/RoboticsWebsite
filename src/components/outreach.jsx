            The Educational Outreach Division is dedicated to encourage and empower future generations to be inquisitive and inventive, to approach any problem with a curious and understanding mind, and to pursue knowledge with an ambitious spirit. At the same time, our divisionâ€™s devoted team of volunteers work tirelessly to promote an inclusive, inspiring environment for children across our local community. We hope to also serve as leading examples of academic excellence and scholastic rigor, with the aim to motivate these same qualities in the students we impact.

            We are currently reaching out to elementary schools in our local community to figure out how we may collaborate in the near future to establish after-school programs for local students. We are mainly in the planning stages, creating the infrastructure and building the connections necessary to achieve our goals.
